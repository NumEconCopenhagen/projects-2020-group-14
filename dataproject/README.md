# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Data Project**. In this project we analyse whether young people in Denmark have the same possibility of a further education dependent on their parents' level of education. Is it easyer for people with well-educated parents to complete further education than it is for others or do we really have equal opportunities in Denmark?

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We use the dataset called data.xslx that we have from table STATUS42 from Danmarks Statistik.
