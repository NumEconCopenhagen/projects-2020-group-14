# Inaugural project

In this project we want to analyse changes in the elasticity of labor supply. How will changes in the elasticity of labor supply affect the tax revenue? To solve this we look at 10000 indivudials. We also examine changes in the taxation to find the optimal tax-rates for the highest ax revenue. 

The results of the project can be seen from running Project0.ipynb.
