# Project 2: Model project

Our model project is an analysis of a Solow model with a changing share of workers in the economy. We want to know, how a change in the labor supply will affect the level of output in steady state. We anaylse this in two situations: an economy with a fixed level of technology and an economy with a growing level of technology. 

We find that an increase in the labor supply is a very effective way to increase the production of an economy. Maybe this could be a part of the solution when Denmark want to get the economy up and running again after the covid19 crisis?

Our results of the project can be seen from running [Model Analysis Project.ipynb](Model Analasis Project.ipynb).
