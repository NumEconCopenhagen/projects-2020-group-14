# Model analysis project

Our model project is an analysis of a solow model with a chaning share of workers in the economy. We want to know, how a change in the labor suply will affect the level of output in steady state. We anaylse this in two situations: First an economy 
technology and second an economy with a growing technology. 

We find that an increase in the labor suply is a verry effective way to increase the production of an economy. Maybe this could be a part of the solution when Denmark want to get the economy up and running again after the Covid-19-crisis?

Our results of the project can be seen from running Model Analysis Project.ipynb.
