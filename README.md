**In this portfolio you'll find four projects**

**Project 0: Inaugural project**
In this project we analyse changes in different tax rates to maximize the tax revenue. We also analyse the effect on tax revenue as a result of a change in the elasticity of labor supply. 

**Project 1: Data project**
In the data project we use data from Denmarks statistics to analyse if it is true that people in Denmark have the same possibility of furhter education. We analyse this by looking at the parants' level of education. 

**Project 2: Model project**
In this project we solve a Solow model with a changing labor supply. Is it possible to increase the output of the ecomomy by changing the share of the population in the labor force? We analyse this both in an economy with a constant level of technology and a changing level of technology.

**Exam project**
In the first part of this project we consider a linear regression from which we estimate the vector of coefficients using both ordinary least squares (OLS) and least absolute deviations (LAD). We repeat the estimations 5000 times using both OLS and LAD and compare the estimates using histograms.

The second part of the project is called "Durable purchases" in which we consider a household living in two periods. In this part we analyse both the utility and the behavior of a household given different values of cash-in-hand. 

In the third and final part of this project we implement a gradient descent algorithm to minimize the function f(x).
